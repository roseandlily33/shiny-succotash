## Usage:
* Must have compass installed for these instructions
Clone the repo to your computer, run npm install, and npm start, it will create a conneciton with your computer via mongodb. From here follow the model, and create students, courses and assignments in either the compass terminal or on a platform like insomnia. 

## Successes and Challenges:
Overall I really enjoyed this mini challenge, I like the structure that mongoose and monogDB gives and how it's very easy to trace and follow throughtout the code. I had an easy time creating the schemas and the routes.
